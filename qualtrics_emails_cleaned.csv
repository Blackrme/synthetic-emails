"Dear Senator Kaine,

I am a resident of Alexandria, VA, and I am seeking your assistance regarding my pending asylum application with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). My interview concluded six months ago, and I have been waiting for a decision far beyond typical processing times.

Despite multiple inquiries, USCIS has not provided a clear timeline or update. This delay is causing extreme hardship, as I am unable to work legally and support my family.

Could your office please inquire with USCIS on my behalf to request a status update or expedite my case?

I have completed the Privacy Release Form and attached it here, along with a copy of my receipt notice.

Thank you for any help you can provide.

I am a constituent in Richmond, VA, and I recently helped my mother apply for a B‑2 visitor visa at the U.S. embassy in Lagos, Nigeria. Unfortunately, her visa application was denied without clear explanation, even though she provided proof of finances, ties to her home country, and intent to visit temporarily.
